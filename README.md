# Digital-Economy-Systems-GigaMap (V1.0)
This system map shows actors, dynamics, flows and relationships of actors in the digital economy.
It utilizes JSON to display the map via [mermaid](https://mermaid.live/) editor

# How to:
Copy and paste the JSON code into the mermaid live editor to display the map as a flow chart.
Tweak and refine.

# Note
Work in progress! Lots of flaws.

The map is designed with a circular or ring structure in mind â€“ which is not possible to display in mermaid.
The map serves as a low fidelity starting point for:
1. further identification of subsystems and dynamics
2. refining fidelity/granularity in Miro/Figma


Ring structure from center to outer layer:
1. R1: CENTRAL NODE: Regular People (RP)
2. R2: Global Financial Institutions (GFI)
3. R3: Financial Flows (FF)
4. R4: Platforms & Labor (PL)
5. R5: Processes & Mechanisms (PM)
6. R6: Resources (RS)
7. R7: Regulatory Bodies (RB)
